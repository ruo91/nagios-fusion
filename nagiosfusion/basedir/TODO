FUSION 2012 TODO
===================
X - Add some sort of sanity check for servers that timeout or can't connect. getmagicpixel pretty much kills the page load
X - Update the poller to output the human readable names for the servers
X - Add a subsystem checker to make sure we know if the subsystem crons aren't actually running like in XI
X - Update CSS to use the rounded corners again


[FEATURES]



[LATER REVISIONS]

- XI 2012 needs a built-in gettacstatus API call to get pre-processed counts
**- Recent Problems Aggregation??

- Save "yesterday's" alert histogram for viewing in graph.
